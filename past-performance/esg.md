PAST PERFORMANCE:

## The Challenge
How does one of the largest providers of financial data streamline their data collection and distribution for Municipal Bond offering documents?

## The Market
The municipal bond market is one of the nation’s most remarkable finance institutions, providing a mechanism whereby more than 50,000 state and local government units can raise money for public purposes such as water and sewer systems, schools, highways and public buildings.  

## The Approach
Qlytics sources and collects over 220,000 Municipal Bond offering documents. We create an automatic workflow for collecting new Offering Documents on a daily basis
Using the Qlytics Document Intelligence NLP Application, bond documents are automatically converted into machine readable electronic format
Knowledge extraction Bots are deployed Outputs are converted into JSON API for easy database input and integration with predictive analytics models
An intuitive interface is designed for identifying exceptions, viewing NLP processes and auditing results
