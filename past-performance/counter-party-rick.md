# PAST PERFORMANCE: AI/ML Driven Counter Party Risk Application
Automated Collection of Regulatory Data and Real-Time Risk Analytics to enable Efficient CounterParty Analysis


## The Challenge
How does one of the world’s largest clearing houses actively monitor and assess the risks for its clearing participants?

## The Market
With the speed of change in market conditions and regulatory requirements, most banks struggle to keep up with their counterparty risk management process. Unlike market risk, which can be effectively managed by individual trading desks or traders, counterparty risk is increasingly being priced and managed by a central CVA desk or risk control group, since the exposure tends to span multiple asset classes and business lines. Moreover, aggregated counterparty exposure may be significantly impacted by collateral and cross-product netting agreements. Today, calculating risk in a manual or even semi-manual process is no longer a viable solution for most organizations.
