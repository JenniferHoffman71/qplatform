## The Challenge
How do asset managers efficiently analyze a company’s ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) performance?

## The Approach
Leveraging the capabilities of the Q-Platform, Qlytics has developed and continues to enhance an ESG scoring framework that provides a quantifiable rating that conforms to generally accepted industry reporting standards including GRI-G4, SASB, UNGC, CDP, IIRC and ISO 14064. Access to this framework is provided via a license to the Q-Platform.  

The ESG framework currently leverages the following Qlytics components:

- Data Collectors
- AI Starter Kit: Source, Collect and Extract
- Data Exchange: ESG Data Set
- Q-Apps: Q-Deep-NLP w/ Custom Rules & Bots
- Custom Taxonomies
- Custom Dashboard
- ESG Scoring Algorithms with customized weights

## Notable Features
Data is automatically extracted from source documents using the Qlytics NLP Solution. This process accelerates the delivery of information.

The source of the information is captured in our system to provide auditability.

The existing ESG questions and their business rules can be further customized to answer additional specific questions, thus automating workflows and providing new insights not offered in the market today.

Additionally, due to the infrastructure of the platform, it can accommodate APIs from traditional data providers.  This feature provides the ability to combine existing vendor data with newly curated information using NLP.

Finally, the application could provide tracking to automate compliance requirements associated with ESG scoring reviews.
